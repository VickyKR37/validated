- A vibrant lime green (#80CBC4), drawing the user's eye to calls to action.
- Clean, modern typography optimized for readability on mobile devices.
- Minimalist icons to represent different sections of the app (e.g., a lightbulb for idea submission, a chat bubble for feedback, a user icon for tester resources).
